# Intro To AI - Final Project, Spring 2017

This project was completed by Kenneth Li and Austin Mann.

This is a Java application, and thus it will require having Java installed on the target system. For best results, have the latest jdk installed on your machine and ensure that it supports compilation and running from the terminal on linux/macOS or the command line on Windows.
The source and class files are contained in the package (com.hangman) directories. A runnable jar has been pre-compiled for convenience. It is in the root 
directory, "HangmanGame.jar"
To run this jar on Windows, run the following command in the cmd window while in the rot directory (the one this readme is in):

	java -jar HangmanGame.jar
  
This will execute the main method. Once it has terminated, the terminal output will declare the winner.
If exceptions are thrown, ensure that the input directory is present and contains the words.txt.
